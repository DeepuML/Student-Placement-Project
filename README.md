# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

This project is a **Machine Learning web app** built with **Streamlit** to predict a student's performance based on various input features such as study time, health, failures, and more. It provides **real-time predictions**, **CSV batch processing**, and **LIME explainability** for model transparency.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔢 Predict student performance using trained ML models
- 📊 Batch prediction using CSV upload
- 📈 SHAP or LIME explainability for predictions
- 💾 Export predictions to CSV
- 🧠 Trained on the UCI Student Performance dataset

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, LIME)
- **Deployment**: Localhost / Streamlit Cloud
- **Dataset**: Student Performance Data from UCI Repository
